### Alexis Butler, Dan O'Keeffe, Santanu Kumar Dash

### Contents
- **./data_collection** → All code to build the graph dataset
- **./dataset** → A compressed snapshot of the graph dataset
              used for the analysis set out in the paper
- **./analysis** → Scripts used to sample and score the security,
               criticality and popularity of packages in the 
               graph dataset
- **./scorecard_validation** → Code used to validate the use of OSSF
               Scorecard as a proxy for security. Validation makes
               use of static analysis vuln density as a more direct
               security measure
